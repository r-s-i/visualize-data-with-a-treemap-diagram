# Movie Sales Treemap

This is my answer to freeCodeCamp's Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram project. I don't know the precise cut-off date for the data used. It seems to be sometime in 2016 since some of the biggest movies of that year is on the list and some are not.

When the user hovers over one of the tiles, a tooltip with name, category, and box-office will appear.

## Getting Started

Simply run the code by opening the index.html file in a web browser (using Live Server). [Or, more conveniently, go to where I host it](https://robiniversen.com/visualize-data-with-a-treemap-diagram/).

## Data Source

The data is fetched from https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/tree_map/movie-data.json
